# Zoe - Front-end

Using React.js, with Typescript and Styled Components.

The app contains a login and registration page, which gives the user access to the main features, such as creating as many goals as you want, creating tasks within each goal and being able to delete and edit these respective items.

All of this done with the integration with our api for [authentication](https://github.com/zoe-app/auth-api), and for [creating goals and tasks](https://github.com/zoe-app/planner-api).
